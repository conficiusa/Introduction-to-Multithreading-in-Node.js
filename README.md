# Introduction to Multithreading in Node.js

Welcome to this practical demonstration of multithreading in Node.js! This project showcases how to leverage parallel processing capabilities in JavaScript using Worker Threads.

Multithreading allows programs to perform multiple operations simultaneously by splitting tasks into separate threads. While JavaScript is single-threaded by nature, Node.js provides the Worker Threads module to achieve true parallel execution.
